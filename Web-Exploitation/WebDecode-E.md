1. Firstly tried intrecting with the page. And played around with it.
2. OnClicking "About" it notified me with "Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there". I viewed source-code of the page and found :-
 '''html
 <section class="about" otify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9"> '''tag
4. I pasted the hash on CyberChef and got the flag.
