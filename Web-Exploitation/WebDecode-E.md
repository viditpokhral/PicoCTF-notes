# Web Challenge Walkthrough

## Initial Interaction
I started by interacting with the web page and exploring its elements. Clicking on the "About" button displayed a notification:

> *"Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there."*

## Source Code Analysis
Following the hint, I viewed the page's source code and discovered the following HTML section:

```html
<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9">
```

The attribute `notify_true` contained an encoded string.

## Decoding the String
I copied the encoded string and used [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode it. The string was Base64-encoded, and after decoding, I retrieved the flag:

```plaintext
picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_02cdcb59}
```

## Conclusion
By following basic web security practices such as inspecting elements and decoding hidden values, I was able to extract the flag successfully.
