# Web Challenge Walkthrough

## Initial Interaction
I started by interacting with the web page and exploring its elements. Clicking on the "About" button displayed a notification:

> *"Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there."*

## Source Code Analysis
Following the hint, I viewed the page's source code and discovered the following HTML section:

```html
<section class="about" notify_true="**********************************************">
```

The attribute `notify_true` contained an encoded string.

## Decoding the String
I copied the encoded string and used [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode it. The string was Base64-encoded, and after decoding, I retrieved the flag:

```plaintext
picoCTF{************************************}
```

## Conclusion
Always first try to play around with the page.
