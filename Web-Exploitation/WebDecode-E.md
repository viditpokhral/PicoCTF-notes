1. Firstly tried intrecting with the page. And played around with it.
2. OnClicking "About" it notified me with "Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there". I viewed source-code of the page and found :-
 ```html
<<<<<<< HEAD
 <section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9"> ```








=======
 <section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9">
```
>>>>>>> 4539914e1cd22a03bfbfd2c8a596bde4162dbd7d
3. I pasted the hash on CyberChef and got the flag.

### Conlusion
Always try to intract with the page and play around with it.
